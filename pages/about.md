## About the Collection

This site contains 25 digitized essays collected from the Folklore Institute that contain legends specific to the Indiana University Bloomington campus, currently spanning from 1958 to 1972. The motivation for creating this collection was to serve as a complement to the [Indiana University Folklore Archives](https://libraries.indiana.edu/folklore-collection) and Dr. John Holmes McDowell's [Folklore of Student Life website](https://f351jmcd.sitehost.iu.edu/), as well as to make these local legends more widely available to researchers (particularly belief scholars and those who study student folklore), current students who may use these materials for coursework, alumni, the Folklore and Ethnomusicology Student Association, and those who have a general interest in folklore, specifically campus legends. This is meant to be a more easily accessible way to learn about campus legends at Indiana University Bloomington without having to visit the archives or the campus events where some of these legends are told. Many people contact the Folklore department and the Folklore and Ethnomusicology Student Association asking about campus legends (particularly in the month of October). Having these in one space will make it easier for individuals to find more information about these legends, such as what legends were most widespread in certain years and how variants of a legend compare and contrast with each other.
