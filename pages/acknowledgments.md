## Acknowledgments

Thank you to the Indiana University Archives for granting access to these materials and allowing me to share them for this project. A special thanks to archivist Carrie Schwier for helping me find relevant materials for this collection and providing clarifying information for some of the documents. This collection would not have been possible without her assistance and expertise. 

Another round of thanks go to the Department of Folklore and Ethnomusicology for their donations to the IU Archives that made this collection a possibility. The banner image on this website comes from the Department's personal collection of photographs, and showcases the original location of their offices, formerly known as the Folklore Institute. This image is used with the permission of the Department of Folklore and Ethnomusicology for the purposes of this repository.
